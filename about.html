                  Aikido is a Japanese Martial Art created during the 1920s by Morihei Ueshiba 
                  (December 14, 1883 – April 26, 1969), an expert who reached the highest level of mastery in the classical
                   Japanese Martial Arts. He is often referred to as "The Founder" Kaiso (開祖) or Ōsensei (大先生/翁先生), 
                   "Great Teacher".  Aikido is  performed by blending with the motion of the attacker and redirecting the force of the attack
                    rather than opposing it head-on. Aikido has not competition. The goal of Aikido training is not  perfection of
                     a step or skill, but rather improving one's character according to the rules of nature.. 
                    Aikido training is intended to promote physical and mental training, 
                    according to the proficiency  level of each skill and repeatedly practice so anyone can practice. 
                    Aikido training is not only good  for health, but also develops self-confidence naturally for daily life. 
                    The dojo is a ideal place to  deepen the understanding of the human eye, to meet people regardless of age, 
                    sex and  Sixty years have passed since the spread of Aikido overseas began. 
                    During this time, Aikido has  become established in 130 countries. Aikido has taken root all over the world 
                    because it is  recognized as a way to train the mind and body, and as such, its value extends beyond 
                    race and border</p>

                    I     received     my     Instructor's     Certificate  through   WAKO   in   2006,  
                    which   is   when   I  opened    my    club,    USAGIGOYA    AIKIDO  DOJO,   in   Mickleover,   Derby. 
                    The   Dojo   is  now based in the City Centre of Derby.  I   taught   Aikido   at   the   BRITANNIA   MILL 
                    campus   of   the   UNIVERSITY   of   DERBY  (which   was   affiliated   with   the   university  through
                    the   UDSU),   where   I   studed   for   a  degree     in     Complementary     Therapies:  SHIATSU I 
                    currently   visit   KYUSHINKAN   DOJO   in  Leicester     every     week,     and     we     hold  courses
                    throughout      the      year      with  instruction from Peter Brown Sensei I     have     attended  
                    several     International  Courses,   which   have   been   instructed   by  Tanaka Shigeho Meiyokancho,
                    Tao Norio Bugaku   Shihan,   Christian   Tissier   Shihan,   Kubota   Ikuhiro   Shihan,   Tada   Hiroshi
                    Shihan,   Ueshiba   Mitsuteru   Sensei   (Waka  Sensei),    Ueshiba    Moriteru    Sensei
                    (the    current    Doshu),    Fujii    Katsutoshi    Sensei,    Sawada    Toshiharu    Shihan, 
                    Kobayashi  Yukimitsu Shihan and Sugawara Shigeru Shihan.  In   2007   I   had   the   chance   to   visit  
                    Japan,   and   during   this   time   was   able   to   train   alongside   other   Aikidoka   in   the 
                    MEIJI   JINGU  BUDODOJO   SHISEIKAN   in   classes   taught   by   Tanaka   Shigeho   Meiyokancho,  
                    Inaba   Minoru   Kancho,   Tao   Norio   Shihan,  Yamada   Shihan   and   Sasada   Shihan.   
                    During   the   trip   to   Japan,   an   invitation   was   given   for   our   group   to   visit   the   
                    AIKIKAI  HOMBU   DOJO,   where   we   were   allowed   to   watch   a   class   on   the   upper   floor, 
                    followed   by   a   private   talk   with   Ueshiba   Moriteru  DOSHU, the current leader of the AIKIKAI 
                    (and the grandson of the founder of Aikido, Ueshiba Morihei O SENSEI).  During   recent   years   
                    I   have   visited   Japan   on   several   occassions,   and   have   been   working   on   creating   links  
                    with   NARA   AIKIKAI,  who   are   under   the   direct   supervision   of   Kubota   Ikuhiro   Sensei,   
                    8th   DAN   Aikikai   SHIHAN.   I   will   be   looking   to   continue   to  strengthen these links with 
                    further visits to Nara in the future. I took my Shodan Aikikai (1st dan) grading in July 2012, 
                    under the supervision of Peter Brown Sensei  I took my Nidan Aikikai (2nd dan) grading in October 2017, 
                    under the supervision of Ikuhiro Kubota Shihan I received my Level 1 Coaching Certificate in July 2012,
                    from the BAB I received my Level 2 Coaching Certificate in July 2017, 
                    from the JAC I received the title of Fukushidoin for Kyushinkan Omeikai in January 2020
